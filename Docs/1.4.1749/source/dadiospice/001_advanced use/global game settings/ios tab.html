<h1 class="studio">The iOS Tab</h1>

<h2 class="studio">This section deals with the iOS tab of the
Global Games Settings Window.</h2>

<p>This iOS tab is split into three separate <i>sub-tabs</i>
(accessible on the left of the window) to make changing and
updating the information for your game clearer and less
complicated. These tabs are explained in the following
sections.</p>

<h3 class="studio">General</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="ios_general_tab.png"> The first thing
to do is fill in the details about your game, including its
<b>Display Name</b>, its <b>App id</b> and the <b>Version</b> info.
Then you will need to give your game its <b>Icons</b>. The icons
should be authored as a individual 32bit <tt>*.png</tt> files of
varying sizes so that they are shown correctly on the store, OS
etc...<br>
<br>
<i><b>NOTE:</b> The Bundle id <b>must</b> be in the correct reverse
URL format for in app purchases to work correctly, EG:
<b>com.[Company].[GameName]</b></i><br>
<br>
The last two sections on this tab are <b>Orientation</b> and
<b>Devices</b>. The orientation section can be used to lock the
game to a specific orientation by checking one or all of the
following options:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>portrait</li>

<li>portrait upside down</li>

<li>Landscape left</li>

<li>Landscape right</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The Devices section is used to target specific iOS platforms,
either <i>iPhone or iPod Touch</i>, <i>iPad</i>, or
<i>both</i>.<br>
<br></p>

<h3 class="studio">Splash Screens</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="ios_splashscreens_tab.png"> This tab
permits you to add separate graphics as splash screens (the image
that will be shown briefly while your app loads) for each of the
different iOS target devices. These images must be authored as
individual 32bit <tt>*.png</tt> images with no transparencies and
at the correct size for each of the devices and orientations
required. You can also set a minimum time for showing the splash
screens from the drop down menu on the right (from 0 to 10
seconds).</p>

<h3 class="studio">Graphics</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="ios_graphics_tab.png"> Once you have
configured the game details and presentation graphics, there are
two more available options on the Graphics tab. The first is the
<b>Interpolate colours Between Pixels</b> option that (when
checked) turns on interpolation, which basically "smooths" pixels.
For crisp pixel graphics, it should be off, but if you have nice
alpha blends and smoothed edge graphics it is better left on. Here
you can also choose to halve texture pages when targeting the iPad1
(which has a lower specification and may not run larger games
otherwise).<br>
<br>
Next there is the option for scaling to the device screen. Here you
can choose to maintain aspect ratio (so a 4:3 room, for example,
will be "letter boxed" on a 16:9) or to scale fully (stretching the
image to fit the full screen).</p>

<blockquote><i><b>WARNING!</b> Switching off the application
surface in your code will disable all the scaling options set here
in the Global Game Settings until it has been switched back on
again. See <a href=
"../../002_reference/surfaces/the%20application%20surface.html">The
Application Surface</a> for further details.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally there is the option to set the size of the <b>Texture
Page</b>. The default (and most compatible) size is 1024x1024, but
you can choose from anywhere between 256x256 up to 2048x2048. There
is also a button marked <b>View</b> which will generate the texture
pages for this platform and then open a window so that you can see
how they look. This can be very useful if you wish to see how the
texture pages are structured and to prevent having texture pages
larger (or smaller) than necessary.</p>

<blockquote><i><b>NOTE:</b> Be aware that the larger the size of
the texture page, the less compatible your game will be.</i>
</blockquote>

<h3 class="studio">Provisioning</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="ios_provisioning_tab.png"> The
<i>Provisioning</i> tab is where you configure the Mac OS options
to get the correct certificates for the iOS export module. Here you
should go to the <b>Provisioning</b> and <b>Certificate</b>
sections to fill in the details of your developer certificates,
which is done by simply clicking on the button marked <b>Refresh
From Mac</b>. Please note this can only be completed successfully
if you have previously signed up for an Apple developer account and
have set up GameMaker: Studio correctly to communicate with your
Mac computer where this information is stored.<br>
<br></p>

<h3 class="studio">Social</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="ios_social_tab.png"> The social tab is
used for setting up Facebook communication in your game. If you
require the Facebook functions, you need to click the "<b>Use
Facebook</b>" checkbox and then supply the Facebook <b>App ID</b>
and <b>Facebook App Display Name</b>. Note that all Facebook
functionality is accessed via an extension, and when you first
check the Use Facebook box you will be prompted to download and
install the Facebook extension from the Marketplace (you may need
to log into your YoYo Account before it can be downloaded).<br>
